Audio Switcher
==============

Audio Switcher is a simple app that runs in the notification area (system tray) and lets you easily switch the default input and output audio devices.

Tired of having to perform a song and dance through the Windows Sound dialogs just to switch from your speakers to your headphones? Then this app is for you.

## How do I install this thing?
Currently, there is no installer or binary that you can run or download. 
You'll need to build the project yourself.

Run `build.ps1` then run `AudioSwitcher.exe` from the bin directory.

## FAQ
#### How do I hide microphones or unplugged devices?
Right-click on the __Audio Switcher__ icon in the notification area, and expand __Appearance__.

#### In the screenshot above, I see that you have given the devices custom names and icons. How do you do that?
Right-click on the __Sound__ icon in the notification area, choose __Playback devices__. Double-click any device to customize its name and icon.
